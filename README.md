## A place for all my web scraping projects and scripts
All scripts are written in Python 3.8.0. The current list is comprised of:
1. **eshop_scraper.py**\
Retrieves all discounted products from [eshop.gr](https://www.e-shop.gr) and outputs them in both json and csv format.
2. **wiki_scraper.py**\
Retrieves a given number of random Wikipedia articles and outputs them in txt files.
3. **wiki_scraper2.py**\
A more ellaborate version of wiki_scraper.py

For further details on Use Case, implementation and running the code, please refer to the individual README of each script.
